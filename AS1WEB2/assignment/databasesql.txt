When IT is developing a new application, for example, the key IT personnel involved must take the time to get to know all the internal and external stakeholders that will be impacted.

Earlier this year, leading up to the Queen’s platinum jubilee, I spent a fruitless couple of days attempting to elicit the views of serving politicians who were known or thought to have republican sympathies. Hardly any responded and only one would go on the record. That exception was Clive Lewis, the Labour MP and 2020 party leadership candidate, who articulated the problem of being an open republican. “The Queen is seen as someone who is hard working, humble, etc,” he said. “I think that makes it very difficult for the republican argument to be put forward.
